# General

- The app looks like a good idea.
- will you slow any city to be entered? 
- how will efficiency be calculated? 
- I like the idea start early with webscraping

# challenges

- we scraping these sites will be a challenge. They hide their stuff well since they make money off you using their site. 
- be careful of how they ask for dates 
- challenges may include how each site returns data to you.
