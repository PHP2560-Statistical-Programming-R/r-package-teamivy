# r-package-teamivy

Our idea is to compare prices between transportation methods

•             Flights, buses, and trains

Our output would be an R markdown file that shows

•             The most efficient option

•             The cheapest option

•             The fastest option

•             Middle ground

•             Wait time

•             Discounts/promotions

#The way we will divide work is:
* We will all take a portion of web scraping from sites including:
    - google flights
    - Expedia.com
    - Amtrak
    - Uber
    - Kayak
    - Greyhound and Peter Pan bus lines
    - Other transportation services and data bases.
    
* and a portion of writing functions.
  - One to calculate an efficiency score
  - One to visualize time of travel
  - One to present a table of all the possible options
  - More ideas to come...
