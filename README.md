Our idea is to compare prices between transportation methods

•             Flights, buses, and trains

Our output would be an R markdown file that shows

•             The most efficient option

•             The cheapest option

•             The fastest option

•             Middle ground

•             Wait time (might delete?)

•             Discounts/promotions (might delete?)

We will all take a portion of web scraping and a portion of writing functions.
